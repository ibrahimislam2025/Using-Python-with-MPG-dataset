# 🐍 Python & Pandas: MPG Data Analysis 🚗⛽  

This project demonstrates **data analysis using Python and Pandas** on a dataset containing **Miles Per Gallon (MPG)** information.  
It covers **importing data, data cleaning, and querying** to extract meaningful insights.  

---

## 🚀 Skills & Tools Demonstrated  
- 🐍 Python Basics for data manipulation and analysis  
- 📊 Pandas Library for data handling and analysis  
- 📥 Data Importing from CSV/Excel files  
- 🧹 Data Cleansing to handle missing or inconsistent values  
- 🔍 Querying & Filtering Data using Pandas commands  
- ⚙️ Using commands such as `head()`, conditional statements (`if/else`), and converting units  
- 💡 Extracting insights like top-performing cars by MPG, averages, and trends  

---

## 📌 Project Highlights  
- 📥 Imported MPG dataset using Pandas  
- 🧹 Cleaned data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies  
- 🔍 Used Pandas commands like `filter()`, `groupby()`, `sort_values()` to find specific data  
- ⚙️ Performed analyses using `head()`, `if/else` conditions, and unit conversions  
- 📊 Analyzed trends and patterns such as **highest MPG vehicles** and **average MPG per year**  
- 💡 Provided insights that can guide fuel efficiency improvements or automotive research
